                    <p>
                        King's Landing is the capital, and largest city, of the Seven Kingdoms. Located on the east coast of Westeros in the Crownlands, just north of where the Blackwater Rush flows into Blackwater Bay and overlooking Blackwater Bay, King's Landing is the site of the Iron Throne and the Red Keep, the seat of the King of the Andals and the First Men (hence the name). It enjoys a warm climate and life there is luxurious for those that can afford it, although it is not without its slums such as Flea Bottom. The city is overpopulated and dangerous at the best of times, despite being policed by the City Watch.

                    <p>
                        In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Bravos are young swordsmen that prowl the city of Braavos during the night. They dress in brightly colored finery and actively seek out fights to prove their skills. Most will fight with little cause, such as a man's opinion on who is the city's most beautiful courtesan, and some with no cause at all. Anyone carrying a sword after dark in Braavos can be challenged to a duel. Simply placing a finger on your sword while facing a bravo is akin to challenging them.

It is situated atop hot springs which keep the castle warm even in the worst winters.[1] Winding tombs below the castle contain the remains of Stark kings and lords and record the history of the ancient family. According to Maester Luwin, there are hidden passageways built in the castle so its Lords could escape. The castle has stood for millennia.</p>
